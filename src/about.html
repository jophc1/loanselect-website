            <h1>Loan Select Cairns Story</h1>
            <p>Hi, my name is David Phillips and I own and run a family business with the help of my wife and two sons in Cairns, North Queensland</p>
            <h3>Experiences</h3>
            <p>Loan Select Cairns is a Loan Broking Service which I started in Cairns in 2000 after I left the Westpac Bank with the closing of my last branch. I am an Accredited Mortgage Consultant and an Authorised Credit Representative under Australian Finance Group. </p>
            <p>I am  also a member of MFAA and Australian Financial Complaints Authority (AFCA). I have completed my Diploma of Financial Services (Finance/Mortgage Broking Management) and I am a Qualified Justice of the Peace in Queensland. In total, I have over 40 years of experience in the financial industry.</p>

            <h3>Goals</h3>
            <p>Our goal is to help our customers through the process of obtaining their home loan from start to finish and then being there for their future needs. My aim is to be like the ‘old fashioned Bank Manager’ who didn't transfer very often and got to know their customers really well. With that approach, comes with a far deeper understanding of their needs.
            </p>
            <p>With the extensive training from Westpac I had over the years I came up with some ideas to better serve customers so that they had a good home loan outcome. I also wanted to use my extensive experience to help my customers navigate their way through the home loan process. </p>
